The database above was constructed via an A K85 injection molding machine from Ferromatik Milacron. The machine contains three adjustable process parameters that can be considered configurable variables. These three variables are the mold temperature, the 2nd pressure value, and the 2nd pressure time of the compaction process. Several combinations of these variables were tested. For each combination of the variables, ten tests were carried out to ensure the stabilization of the process, with only the pressure and temperature data from these tests being acquired. Two sensors, a temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor have been installed and localized on the mold, to measure the mold temperature and the pressure. For selecting an optimal localization of the aforementioned two sensors, firstly a study of the temperature distribution and the pressure effect within the mold was carried out. After detecting the best localization, two sensors were installed in the selected spots. The pressure and temperature sensors to be used are the Priamus 6001B and a type K thermonuclear, respectively.
